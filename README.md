# React Native Weather App

This React Native Weather App automatically detects the user's location and provides real-time weather information along with a 5-day forecast. The app fetches weather data from an API and displays it in a user-friendly interface using `FlatList` for efficient rendering.

## Features

- **Automatic Location Detection**: The app automatically detects the user's current location using the device's GPS.
- **Real-Time Weather Data**: Fetches and displays current weather information based on the user's location.
- **5-Day Weather Forecast**: Provides a 5-day weather forecast with detailed information for each day.
- **FlatList Implementation**: Efficient rendering of the 5-day forecast using `FlatList` for better performance.
